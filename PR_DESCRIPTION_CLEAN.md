## 🙏 Additional Info (if any):

### 🔒 **Security Vulnerabilities Addressed:**
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy + SRI hashes prevent script injection
- **Clickjacking Prevention**: X-Frame-Options blocks malicious iframe embedding  
- **MIME Confusion**: X-Content-Type-Options prevents browser misinterpretation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: HSTS with preload forces secure connections
- **Privacy Protection**: Referrer policy controls information leakage

### 📊 **Impact Assessment:**
- **✅ Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **✅ Performance Maintained**: No degradation in page load times
- **✅ Analytics Working**: Google Analytics and AdSense continue functioning

### 🧪 **Testing Completed:**
- Security headers verified in browser developer tools
- SRI hashes validated for all external resources  
- Analytics initialization tested and working
- Error handling tested for failed resource loads

**This implementation follows industry best practices while maintaining the original user experience and significantly improving the platform's security posture.** 🚀
