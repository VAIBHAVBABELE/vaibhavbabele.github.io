# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented for the Nitra Mitra website as part of GSSoC'25 contribution.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI) Hashes
**Problem**: CDN resources were loaded without integrity verification, making the site vulnerable to CDN tampering attacks.

**Solution**: Added SRI hashes for all external CDN resources:
- Bootstrap CSS/JS from cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Font Awesome CSS from cdnjs.cloudflare.com  
- Marked.js and DOMPurify from unpkg.com and cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Typed.js from unpkg.com
- Phosphor Icons from unpkg.com

**Files Updated**: 
- index.html
- assistant.html
- infrastructure.html
- paper.html
- privacy.html
- contact.html

### 2. Hardcoded API Keys and Configuration
**Problem**: Google Analytics and AdSense IDs were hardcoded in HTML files, making configuration management difficult and potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Solution**: Created centralized configuration management system:
- `js/config.js`: Centralized configuration object
- `js/analytics.js`: Dynamic script loading with error handling
- Removed hardcoded API keys from HTML files

**Benefits**:
- Easier configuration management
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability
- Enhanced security through controlled script loading

### 3. Missing Security Headers
**Problem**: Website lacked important security headers making it vulnerable to various attacks.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive security headers in `.htaccess`:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- X-XSS-Protection for XSS filtering
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection
- Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement

## Technical Implementation

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" 
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH"
      crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### Configuration Management
```javascript
// js/config.js
const SITE_CONFIG = {
    analytics: {
        googleAnalyticsId: 'G-WZP9NSCWF5',
        adsenseId: 'ca-pub-1013609987989002'
    }
};
```

### Dynamic Script Loading
```javascript
// js/analytics.js
function initializeAnalytics() {
    if (SITE_CONFIG.analytics.googleAnalyticsId) {
        // Load Google Analytics dynamically
    }
}
```

### Security Headers
```apache
# .htaccess
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net..."
Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
```

## Security Benefits

1. **CDN Tampering Protection**: SRI hashes ensure that if a CDN is compromised, tampered scripts won't execute
2. **XSS Attack Prevention**: CSP headers restrict script execution sources
3. **Clickjacking Protection**: X-Frame-Options prevents the site from being embedded in malicious frames
4. **MIME Sniffing Protection**: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as different MIME types
5. **Enhanced HTTPS Security**: HSTS headers enforce secure connections
6. **Configuration Security**: Centralized config management reduces exposure of sensitive data

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration Files
- `js/config.js` (NEW) - Centralized configuration management
- `js/analytics.js` (NEW) - Dynamic analytics loading
- `.htaccess` (UPDATED) - Added security headers

### HTML Pages Updated with SRI
- `index.html` - Main page
- `assistant.html` - AI assistant page  
- `infrastructure.html` - Infrastructure page
- `paper.html` - Papers page
- `privacy.html` - Privacy policy page
- `contact.html` - Contact page

## Testing Recommendations

1. **SRI Validation**: Verify all CDN resources load correctly with integrity checks
2. **CSP Testing**: Test that all legitimate scripts work with the new Content Security Policy
3. **Analytics Testing**: Confirm Google Analytics and AdSense still function with dynamic loading
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across different browsers
5. **Security Header Verification**: Use online tools to verify security headers are properly set

## Maintenance Notes

- SRI hashes must be updated when CDN resource versions change
- Configuration changes should be made in `js/config.js`
- New external scripts must follow the same SRI implementation pattern
- Security headers may need adjustment when adding new external services

## Compliance

These improvements help the website meet modern web security standards and best practices, including:
- OWASP security guidelines
- CSP Level 3 recommendations  
- SRI specification compliance
- HTTPS best practices
